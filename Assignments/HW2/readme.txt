The 'HW2' file is in a ".ipynb" extension.

The Program can be run in any IDE`s that support the extension like pycharm, VScode, etc..., or we can run it in the jupyter notebook.

Open the file and Select the kernal as 'python' and Click on 'run all'.(contains all questions, includes 7th question --> no seperate command to run this question.)

Note: The Output is too large for it to be displayed all in the cell itself as Output exceeds the size limit. Click on Open the full output data in a "text editor".
